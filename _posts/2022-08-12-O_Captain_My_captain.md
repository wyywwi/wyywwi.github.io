> ### O Captain! My Captain!
>
> *BY WALT WHITMAN*
> 
> O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
>
> The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
>
> The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
>
> While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
>
> ​             But O heart! heart! heart!
>
> ​              O the bleeding drops of red,
>
> ​                Where on the deck my Captain lies,
>
> ​                 Fallen cold and dead.
>
> O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
>
> Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,
>
> For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
>
> For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
>
> ​             Here Captain! dear father!
>
> ​              This arm beneath your head!
>
> ​                It is some dream that on the deck,
>
> ​                 You’ve fallen cold and dead.
>
> My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
>
> My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
>
> The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
>
> From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
>
> ​              But I with mournful tread,
>
> ​                Walk the deck my Captain lies,
>
> ​                 Fallen cold and dead.
