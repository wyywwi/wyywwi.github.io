## Welcome to wyywwi's GitHub Page

</br>

For some days, I have been thinking about build a personal page. However, I have nothing to put onto it and cloud servers are too expensive to afford to me. So I'm glad to find this free webpageservice here to put something here and share them to you.

### For my notes, click here:

1. [basic Linux operation](https://wyywwi.github.io/notes/linux/)
2. Vim learning notes
3. Git & Github
4. GCC
5. Apache2 in Linux
6. Basic Mysql

Maybe these notes are too simple, but they are at least useful to me. I hope they are useful to you too.
